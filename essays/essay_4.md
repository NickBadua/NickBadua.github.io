<h3> My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways: </h3>
The biggest way my programming skills has improved is that I now have programming skills. The word ‘skills' is obviously used in a relative sense here but now I can actually understand what I’m looking at and can look at others’ code and (most times) decipher what the code is supposed to do. 

<h3>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills: </h3>
The main thing that I need to work on is first thinking about what I want to do. Even though it was advised in the instructions of Assignment 1 to first comment out an outline of what you want the code to do, I did not. I took it one step at a time--big mistake. I often found myself completing a block of code that did what I needed it to do for the moment, and then upon moving on and wanting something else to happen, I discovered that I needed to rewrite the previous code entirely to make it work together. First creating a plan would have saved me so much time.

<h3>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast: </h3>
While I definitely have learned a lot from doing the WODs, admittedly, in most of them, there was inevitably a moment when I need some direction. There was always one requirement that I was completely left blank on that would just run up the timer. Then, after seeing how the Professor did the one requirement, I would be able to continue through the rest of the WOD without having to refer to the screencast. Of course, my solution was not of the best quality, but it worked nonetheless! Perhaps now, after having finished Assignment 1, I can do the WODs without the assistance of the screencast. 

<h3>The labs have helped me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence: </h3>
I’d say the labs have helped me learn way more than reading the required documents prior to class. I always found myself dedicating a few hours to read the documents and watching the screencast only to not retain any of it. Although the Professor would constantly say that the labs didn’t cover everything, I feel that the Professor was able to explain the concepts that were present in the labs much better in class. Now would be able to complete them with confidence? I mean we never had to complete the majority of the labs on our own so I don’t necessarily know in regards to those labs, but for the past 3 labs (maybe 2?) we’ve been having to finish the labs on our own and I’ve been able to follow the instructions, understand what to do, and finish them. In fact, having to finish the rest of the labs on our own has pushed me to gain a better understanding of that module’s concepts. Weirdly, I think I’m much more well-versed in server-side processing than things like functions since we had to complete the server lab on our own.

<h3>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</h3>
This is absolutely true. I think, for most of the semester, I had been kinda just learning passively. In other words, I was learning about the different tools that one could use in coding but didn’t entirely understand how they would be used together. In doing Assignment 1, I was forced to finally sit down and think logically about how to get something I wanted to happen work. In some cases, I’d take a few hours, and, in others, it would take days of staring at my code. This was largely facilitated due to the lack of solution screencasts that I would otherwise have during WODs to fall back on when I got stuck. Because of that, I learned way more and feel much more confident in my ability to code and feel ready to work on Assignment 2.

<h3>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h3>
Like I’ve already said, pushing us to complete certain portions of labs on our own was huge in helping me learn the features of the programmign language. Of course, if I was a student who eagerly wanted to excel, I would already do this without the teacher forcing it on me, but I’m not--what can I say? 

<h3>What helps me the most in class are: </h3>
The labs help a lot in showing me how features in javascript/HTML can work to produce something. I think the examples in the labs are huge in helping me gain a better understanding of things. The screencasts also to a certain extent help me too, but I feel that I have learned the best through the Professor showing us, through the labs, how the feature in javascript/HTML can be used. A byproduct of this is teaching us what the feature actually is.
