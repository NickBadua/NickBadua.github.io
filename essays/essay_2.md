Working on the first set of WODs was an interesting experience. First, working on BrowserHistory1 was less about me learning how to do everything for the first time and more about trying to re-remember what I had learned in ICS 101. The first WOD right off the bat seemed very basic and after about 3 tries, I finally got a time that I wanted. During my first try, I decided to set the timer before having read the instructions so, in essence, my first screencast was about 30 minutes of me reading the instructions. For a while, I was also stuck on creating links to the same page for the table of contents section. I was taking so long on that part that I had to stop the recording. I knew it’d be similar to creating the external link, but I could not figure out why it wasn’t linking to the IDs I had set up until I searched it up and found out that you needed the hashtag before the ID. Overall, BrowserHistory1 wasn’t too bad except for the link to the same page of course.

BrowserHistory2 took me surprisingly fewer attempts than the first WOD. I think, for the most part, it’s because I approached it with the mindset that I’m trying to beat a time. Not only that, but CSS wasn’t too difficult for me to understand and I was able to complete the instructions and replicate the reference image pretty quickly. During my first attempt, I successfully just made it to 20 minutes, but in that attempt, I downloaded the Oswald and Open Sans font from the Google Fonts website and onto my computer. After watching the screencast of Prof. Johnson doing it, it was then when I realized that I had done it wrong and needed to insert Google Web Fonts links directly in the code. This is probably important to remember since most people won’t have special fonts on their own computer. Honestly, I had no idea how to do that so I had to refer to the resources in the module for help. Once I had that corrected, I reset the timer, started the recording, and was surprised to find that I had a time that fell under the Rx category.

Finally, BrowserHistory3 was probably the hardest for me. I knew how to get rid of the table of contents and turn it into the navigation bar. That was just a matter of removing the list tags and adding some paddings to the CSS file so I could evenly space out the text. When it came down to creating three columns, the method I had initially thought of did not work as intended. I thought I could just insert the max-width to the paragraph and that would have worked, but it didn’t create three columns but instead made it into one. After trying to find out how to do it on my own for a while (well, actually it was an unreasonably long while), I finally had to do some research and then found out I could just use the same method I used in the previous WOD: float. It worked great. 

Overall, while there were a few moments of frustration, the first three WODs were not so bad. However, I did experience a prevailing issue with the server not displaying my updates to my Html code on the webpage whenever I would refresh. While I ultimately chose to access the page by inserting the file path into the address bar during my screencasts, offline, I finally learned that you needed to do a force restart on the webpage for it to show the updated Html code because of cache issues. Other than that, I would say working on the first set of WODs was a successful run.
