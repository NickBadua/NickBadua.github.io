While most would tune in to the Super Bowl for the game, for me, the big event was the 30-second ads between the game. I’ve always been fascinated by the world of Marketing and advertisements. I love the creative aspects as well as the less glamorous, data analytics. That being said, I still realize the increasingly large part that technology continues to consume in everyday life.

Being that technology is so ingrained in every aspect of our lives, I feel that it would be hugely beneficial to me to take ITM 352. For one, it would set me apart from my peers who have decided to solely focus on learning marketing. This, in turn, could possibly open me up to more positions in the marketing profession where the competition for a job is comparatively lower because people lack experience with certain technology and coding. And, even in the event that I don’t actually need coding in the future, my small past experiences in coding have, at the very least, strengthened my critical thinking and patience due to the tedious nature of coding. Additionally, it would be useful to get exposed to certain verbiage used among software engineers so as not to be completely clueless in certain situations. 

Now, I’ve decided to take ITM 352 instead of an entry-level course intended for students wanting to graduate with a major in computer science because I think learning how to code e-service applications is arguably a more effective method in developing and quickly reinforcing a coding skill. I, personally, learn better with hands-on and applied learning as opposed to lecturing. In completing this course, I hope to gain a better understanding of how technology works and attain a basic level of coding.
