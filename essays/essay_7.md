<h3>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</h3>
This is a store that sells tennis gear. Anywhere from rackets and tennis balls to tennis shoes and clothes. 

<h3>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h3>     
Currently, when you make changes to your quantities on the shopping cart page, it doesn’t actually change the amount taken out of the inventory since that was taken out immediately after adding to the cart. 

<h3>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</h3>
I’m really proud of all the for-loops and arrays that I’ve had to construct in order to display the products and maintain quantities. While I was making it I was literally yelling out from the frustration but seeing that it all worked out (for the most part) makes me really proud. But overall, I’m really proud of everything about it. I mean, I look at it and just think about how a few months ago I couldn’t differentiate a <b> tag from a <br>.

<h3>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</h3>
I am currently not happy with how my shopping cart quantities feature works because it doesn’t. When you change the quantities, it doesn’t update the inventory accordingly. As I am writing this, I was not able to think of a solution for it. 

<h3>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h3>
It was different in it that this assignment required me to read more on sessions. For some reason, during the class lab, I was following along, but I couldn’t wrap my mind around how a session could be used for a shopping cart. Basically, I had to do more reading/watching youtube tutorials specifically about sessions and cookies. My initial lack of understanding was probably why the brainstorming of how to approach assignment 3 took so long.

<h3>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h3>
My problems mostly arose during the brainstorming portion of writing the code. There are some things that I was just completely blank on. Whenever that happened, I would read some documentation to discover more about how something works. My last resort was looking up examples of code on google.

<h3>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</h3>
Actually reading the documentation worked really well. I definitely relied on documentation on this assignment much more than I did in previous assignments.

<h3>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</h3>
Trying to figure out how I could use sessions without really having a base understanding of it. That seems like a horrible way to approach an assignment in hindsight. It turned out to be much simpler than what I initially thought.

<h3>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</h3>
I learned that maybe I should anticipate future assignments, especially if it builds off of the previous one. Thinking about future requirements would have saved me so much time. It took a good chunk of time just getting a working assignment 2 again after changing a few things for assignment 3. 

<h3>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</h3>
I would have started this assignment even earlier. I started before the checkpoint for the assignment was due, but even then I feel like I didn’t have enough time. A huge portion of it was also changing assignment 2 code to fit the new assignment 3 requirements (i.e., changing the product data to include 3 categories).

<h3>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h3>
I must’ve spent 75% of the time thinking about how to do something because I initially could not wrap my head around sessions and then when I read the documentation about it, I realized that it was actually so simple. Writing the code probably took up about 10% of the time because, as I said, once I thought out how to do something, it wasn’t too hard to implement it. Testing and debugging probably took like 5% of the time. I got pretty quick at reading the error message and then seeing what line it was and fixing it.


<h3>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</h3>
I worked on the project entirely on my own so I’d say I contributed 100%.
