<h3>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</h3>
In this assignment, the only thing we really had to do was create a login page as well as a registration page. Unlike the previous assignment, we required the customer to log in before accessing the invoice. This information was then used to personalize the invoice with a greeting. Now this is a reflection of my experience working on Assignment 2.

For more information on this assignment.
  
<h3>What did you learn from this assignment?</h3>
From this, I learned how to use the file system to write. I also learned--the hard way--that nodemon restarts the server automatically whenever I do a writefilesync. What would happen is my quantities would revert to the original amounts even after the invoice because nodemon would stop and start the server. After DAYS of being stumped, I discovered that that wasn’t an issue if I used ‘node server.js.’ Other than that, It’s been a while since I worked on Assignment 2, but I’m pretty sure my methods were pretty much the same as assignment 1.

<h3>Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</h3>
I worked alone. 

<h3>How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</h3>
While I did not seek help from the professor, I did use google to help me with some code. For example, I had no clue how to require email formatting for the email field on the registration page. After googling, I found a convenient validation that would do it for me and it saved me a ton of time. 

<h3>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</h3>
Developing this assignment was different mostly because I had to change preexisting code. That was kinda frustrating because I often had to change multiple locations in the code to ensure things still worked properly. Other than that, I definitely relied on commenting first and then writing the code afterward more than I did in Assignment 1. That was really helpful.

<h3>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h3>
If I had to break it down, I spent probably 60% thinking about how to do something, 30% writing the code, and 10% debugging. Honestly, I think, because I spent so much time thinking about how to do something, there wasn’t much to debug.

<h3>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</h3>
I remember having trouble keeping the quantities in the query string as I went from the products display page to the login to the invoice. For some reason, even though it was in the query string array while I was on the login page, after posting, it would disappear even though I did the exact same thing I did to carry the quantities from the products page to the login page. So I ended up having to change the action to include the quantities. 

<h3>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h3>
While I think googling was a quick fix to many of my issues, I think I should probably go ask the professor for help on some problems. I feel like he’d be able to explain to me the issue better and maybe give even me a better understanding of how things work.
