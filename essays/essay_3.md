In this WOD, we were tasked to create a table that served as a sales receipt comprised of variables for easy future manipulation. More information can be found [here](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html).  At first glance, this WOD was really daunting. Although I knew how to declare variables, knowing that I had no idea where to start when creating a table, I thought I was gonna have to go through several DNFs before I got anywhere close to the average time. In reality, it wasn’t too bad, mainly because, like a reverberating voice at the back of my head, I remembered that Professor Port mentioned several times to “get used to copy-pasting!” Thus, the view page source became my best friend when creating the table.

My first attempt was really long. It exceeded the 40-minute mark by a significantly large margin. Again, I knew how to set up the variables and have them successfully do the required calculations, but, for a while, I just had no idea how to insert the variables into the table. After a long while of trying my best to figure it out on my own, I had to resort to doing some research, it was then when I realized that (obviously) the document.write() and the variables in the string templates must be used within <script></script>. After that, I was off and running. The rest was just a matter of doing that again though with a few adjustments.

I did a little preparation before trying the WOD which was more than I did for the previous WODs. I skimmed through the module’s readings on w3schools just to refresh my memory on a few things, but it didn’t necessarily end up helping a whole lot. Other than that, my approach to this WOD was similar to the previous WODs. Do some research so as to not be completely blank for the 40-minutes, try it out with the stopwatch running with little concern for the time, and then do it again though at a quicker pace. Maybe in future WODs, I could spend more time preparing beforehand than the amount of time that I have been spending preparing for the previous WODs.
